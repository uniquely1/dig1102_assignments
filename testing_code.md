Why test your code as yoiu write it:

* Instant Gratification: Unit testing allows you to execute your code right away and know that it works. 
This is a very powerful tool. One of the reasons I enjoy programming is seeing the results of what I built.

* Unit testing allows you to instantly try out your code and see it working.

* Code Against Your API While or Before it is Built: Unit testing gives you the chance to code against your 
API/class while you build it, or in the case of TDD, before you build it. Your tests then become a template 
for future classes that use the API. They will interact with it the same way that a client class will.

* Leads to a Better Design: Since unit testing should start very early in the process of writing code, it can 
help you to design an API. Since the tests will become templates as to how to use the class under test, you 
can get a feel for how natural the API feels. This ultimately leads to a better design and helps you to choose 
good names for methods and also to determine which methods are really needed.

* Understand How Your Code Works: Unit tests really work out your code and tell you how your code will act 
under many different scenarios. Whether the tests pass or fail, you will learn something about how your code executes.

* Confidence in Your Code: You may have heard the phrase “Refactor without fear” and unit testing gives you this 
capability. This means that you can make changes to your code and instantly know whether those changes have broken it. 
When you have a good baseline of tests, you know your code works and you don’t have to be afraid of changes to it in the future.

Why you shouldn't test yoiur code while writing it:
* I can't think of any GOOD reasons to do this; even though I am new to this type of code writing; it makes no sense to me not to 
* test as I go!
